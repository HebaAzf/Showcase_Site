        We asked all current VCP members and staff and invite all patrons to share where they come from. 
        
        For some, it may mean one pin in one place, for others it may mean multiple pins in different places. 
        
        For some, it may be a pin in the place your family comes from, for others where you were born, and for others the place you grew up.`,

        description: `Throughout the history of Canada, Indigenous Peoples have been removed from the lands that once sustained them — relocated to ever-diminishing reserves.
        
        In some territories, Canada and Indigenous Peoples signed treaties to share the lands and waters. But Canada’s implementation of the treaties has, in almost every instance, failed to honour that understanding.
        
        In other territories, Indigenous Peoples did not sign treaties. In these territories, Indigenous Peoples made no legal agreements with Canada to share responsibility of the lands and waters.
        In essence, Canada took governance of these lands and resources without consent.
        
        The first step in understanding the Land Back movement is understanding that we are on Indigenous land.
        
        Place a pin where you currently live then visit native-land.ca where you will be prompted to put in your address to learn about the Territories, Treaties and Languages that co-exist with where you live.
        
        Please take a moment to honour the lands on which you live which was stolen from the original caretakers of the land.

        De-colonization is our responsibility.`,
